# rxjs-test-scheduler
An RxJS5 implementation of a scheduler which aims to make testing of time based operations easier.

*Note: This project is a work in progress and is by no means ready for production use. So you may encounter various issues/bugs with this test scheduler.*

**PR's welcome!**

## Example Unit Test

You can find a self-explanatory example unit test written using Jest at: [client/app/main.spec.ts](https://github.com/sbm007/rxjs-test-scheduler/blob/master/client/app/main.spec.ts)

*Note: This can be ran using **npm run test** after doing an **npm install**.*

## Implementation

The implementation of the test scheduler can be found at: [client/app/\_\_mocks\_\_/TestScheduler.ts](https://github.com/sbm007/rxjs-test-scheduler/blob/master/client/app/__mocks__/TestScheduler.ts)

*Note: This is written using TypeScript*

## Usage

*Coming soon: A proper npm package with a copy of the test scheduler for distribution purposes is in the works.*
